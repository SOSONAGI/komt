{"id": 7, "instruction": "왜 세계시간의 기준이 영국의 GMT인가요? 그 이유는 무엇일까요?", "result": "The reason why the world standard time is based on Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) in the United Kingdom is a historical accident that dates back to the late 19th century.\nIn the 19th century, the need for a universal time standard became increasingly important as railroads and other forms of transportation expanded across different time zones. Prior to this, each city or region had its own local time standard, which made it difficult to coordinate schedules and travel.\nIn 1884, the International Meridian Conference was held in Washington, D.C., where representatives from 25 countries agreed to establish a universal time standard based on the mean solar time at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, London. This time standard was called Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).\nThe reason why the conference chose Greenwich as the reference point is not entirely clear, but it is believed to have been due to the observatory's reputation as a reliable timekeeping institution. The Royal Observatory had been in operation since 1675 and had a long history of precise timekeeping.\nOver time, GMT became the de facto standard time for the world, and it remains the basis for modern time zones. Today, most countries around the world use GMT or a similar time standard, although some countries have their own local time standards that differ from GMT by a few hours.\nIn summary, the reason why the world standard time is based on GMT in the United Kingdom is due to a combination of historical accident and the reputation of the Royal Observatory in Greenwich as a reliable timekeeping institution.</s>"}
